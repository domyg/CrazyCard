# CrazyCard
Academic Project for Web System Design and Architecture course

During this individual project I'd the opportunity to explore the back-end and the front-end development.
I actually focussed on the back-end side, as our professors asks, to learn how a web application works and how a powerful framework like Spring Boot can make it working easy than the classic servlet approach.

The project is just a Credit Card System for prepaid and rechargeable card that a use can buy in a physical shop or just online.
Every user has an account and can buy more credit cards.

Also the system support access from admin of the Credit Card company and reseller from several stores.
